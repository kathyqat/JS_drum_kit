# javascript_drum_kit

From the [JavaScript 30 Day Challenge](https://javascript30.com/) by Wes Bos. I learned of this challenge from The Odin Project's (TOP) [Full Stack Development](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/dom-manipulation) course.

HTML and CSS were already set up when I cloned the project; all I did was add interactivity with JavaScript. I spent way more time debugging and looking up things than writing code. But I'm pleased that I used loops instead of making conditional statements for every possibility.

My drum kit was not originally spammable, but I didn't know some things existed until I looked at the offical solution. I added extra code to increase responsive-ness. It is a bit frustrating to not know what you don't know, but I did the best I could with the knowledge that I had.
